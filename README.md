[CMP343] Personal Project

Senior year software engineering project.  Android application that simulates a fantasy football type app based upon the show "The Bachelor".  This project is not finished.  Written Java using the App Inventor Bridger API.  In the future I plan on actually writing the whole app in JavaScript and making it an SPA as well as android and ios apps.
